CREDIT CARD DATA ANALYSIS - KEY INSIGHTS

1. Customer Balances
Most customers maintain a relatively low balance. A small portion carries very high balances, which could indicate potential debt risk.

2. Purchasing Behavior
There is a significant number of users with zero purchases, suggesting either inactive accounts or a preference for using cash. Among active users, installment purchases are more common than one-off large purchases.

3. Credit Limit Utilization
Some users are using more than 80 percent of their credit limit regularly. These customers may pose a higher credit risk. On the other hand, many customers are under-utilizing their credit limits, which could be an opportunity for upselling or cross-selling.

4. Payments and Repayment Behavior
Some customers consistently pay more than their total due, possibly to avoid interest or manage debt effectively. Others only pay the minimum amount, which may lead to long-term debt and financial stress.

5. Correlations and Risk Indicators
There is a strong correlation between balance, payments, and credit limit. Customers who pay their full balance tend to avoid interest charges, which reduces profitability but also lowers risk.

6. Profit Opportunities
Customers who regularly make only minimum payments generate more interest revenue but also present a higher default risk. Offering installment plans and special offers to low-spending users could help boost profit margins.

7. Risk Management
Customers with high balances and low payment behavior should be flagged as high-risk. Creating customer segments based on risk levels can help with better credit management.

8. Operational Recommendations
Monitor high utilization customers closely for early signs of default. Design marketing campaigns to encourage spending among customers with low activity. Offer financial advice or reminders to customers nearing their credit limits.

SUMMARY

This analysis gives a clear picture of customer behavior. It identifies ways to increase profitability while also managing risk. The insights from this project can be used for better decision-making in customer segmentation, credit policy, and marketing strategies.
